Naturally occurring in the earth's crust, arsenic can leach into groundwater, leading to contamination of water supplies used for drinking, food preparation, and irrigation. This contamination has been identified in regions across the globe, including parts of the United States, India, Bangladesh, and China. Long-term exposure to arsenic-contaminated water can result in severe health issues, including various cancers and skin lesions.
